<TLDR label="">
  Keeping **CommVergent Technologies** and **CommVergent Automation** separate avoids mixed
  messaging and lets each team speak directly to its buyersâ€”while reusing visual identity where it
  helps.
</TLDR>

## What prompted the split

- Partners and offerings diverged.
- Prospects were landing on automation content when they needed broader consulting (and vice-versa).
- SEO and messaging conflicted (two sets of keywords competing under one roof).

## How we implemented it

- **Shared look, separate missions.** Same core wordmark; tailored taglines and navigation.
- **Two sites.** Tech site in **Next.js + Tailwind + MDX**; Automation remains a dedicated React app.
- **Cross-links, not cross-menus.** Clear CTAs to jump between sites without blending service catalogs.

## Go-to checklist

- Homepage promise in one sentence, per site.
- Services pages scoped to that site only.
- Contact routes separate (shared inbox ok, distinct forms better).
- Cross-domain analytics + clear attribution.

_Result: fewer confused leads, better search performance, happier partners._
