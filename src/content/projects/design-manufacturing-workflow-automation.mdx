## Overview

We implemented an end-to-end workflow that connects offshore designers, listing/publishing operations, and on-site manufacturing. The system replaces email handoffs and manual listing work with a structured, searchable process that keeps work moving across time zones and delivers a clean production queue.

## Problem

- Designers were offshore in different time zones, causing handoff delays and unclear status.
- Store listings were manual — including **discrete** product image production — leading to slow updates and inconsistent quality.
- Manufacturing relied on manually managed print files in shared folders that had to be searched repeatedly.

## Solution

- **Workflow + notifications:** A formal assignment → review → approval flow with robust notifications replaced ad-hoc email threads, enabling asynchronous collaboration across time zones.
- **Automated listings & images:** Generated listing data from templates and pushed updates via API; automated image overlays/brand frames and stored assets by listing for consistent, publish-ready output.
- **Central database:** All design and product artifacts captured in a relational database so every asset is **correlated and searchable** (designs ↔ listings ↔ print files ↔ work orders).
- **Manufacturing organization:** Approved designs auto-generated work orders and labels, feeding a prioritized production queue so the floor always knew what was next.

## How it works

1. **Ingest** — Designers submit assets/specs; validations check completeness.
2. **Process** — Images run through batch overlay/standardization; metadata is templated and versioned.
3. **Approve** — Reviewers approve/reject with one click; notifications drive the next step.
4. **Publish** — Listings and assets are pushed to the storefront/marketplaces.
5. **Make** — Approved jobs create work orders; the queue updates in real time.

## Tech

- SQL (relational database)
- ASP.NET MVC 5
- Batch image processing
- REST APIs
- Job queues

## Outcomes

- Eliminated most manual listing steps; consistent, on-brand images across variants.
- Clear status and continuous handoffs across time zones (fewer stalls, less back-and-forth).
- Production floor moved from folder hunting to a prioritized, searchable queue of approved jobs.
