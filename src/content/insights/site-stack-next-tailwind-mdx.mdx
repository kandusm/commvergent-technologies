## Why this stack

- **Next.js 15 (App Router):** file-based routes, server components, easy SEO.
- **Tailwind 4:** consistent design tokens, small CSS, quick iteration.
- **MDX:** prose + components in one file—great for Insights and Projects.

## Contact without a backend

We use **Formspree** for the contact form:

- Client-only submit to `https://formspree.io/f/…`
- Honeypot field (`_gotcha`) and JSON response handling
- Swap to Resend/Postmark later if needed

## Scheduling

A simple **“Schedule a call”** button links to **Microsoft Bookings**. No iframe needed; open in a new tab for reliability.

## What this buys us

- Editors can add posts as `.mdx` without touching routes.
- Engineers can embed components inline (charts, callouts).
- Deploy anywhere; IIS or Vercel both work with the same build.
